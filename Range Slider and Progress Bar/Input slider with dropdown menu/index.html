                              hair reduction, which goes by body part. The
                              amount of time varies from person to person; for
                              example, one person removing underarm hair may
                              need 30 minutes because they have sparse hair, but
                              a second may need 60 minutes or more.

                              That said, if you’re about average, most small
                              areas (lip, chin, eyebrows, fingers, etc) may take
                              15 minutes (range from 5-30 minutes), underarms
                              may average 45-60 minutes (range from 15-120
                              minutes), and so on.

                              Since we can’t see how much hair you have over the
                              phone (even if we’d like to!), we offer free
                              consultations to do just that - we’ll give better
                              estimates regarding the number and length of
                              treatments when you come in.
